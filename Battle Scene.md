# Battle Scene: The Awakening

## Prelude: Discovery and Warning

The secret organization, founded in Ancient Egypt to hunt alien technologies, finally locates the sleeping herald's tomb hidden in the Egyptian desert. The settlement of Cleopatra's followers has guarded this secret location for over 2000 years, though many residents don't know the true purpose of their settlement.

The herald's assistant, a living creature loyal to the alien, is scouting outside the settlement when she notices military equipment moving toward them with hostile intent. She quickly runs back to warn the settlement leader.

The leader is shocked—their sensors and probes failed to detect the approaching threat. The settlement mobilizes immediately. Weapons are distributed, heavy weaponry is pulled out. Those who knew about the alien's presence warn the others: "Hide. Everything is very bad, there's going to be a big confrontation."

## The Confrontation Begins

The secret organization arrives with tanks and infantry, surrounding the settlement. Their antagonist leader—a ruthless operative—negotiates first: "Guys, you can't handle us, surrender. We only need this place."

But settlements remain loyal to their ancient oath. More than 2000 years ago, Cleopatra herself gave the order to guard the herald at the cost of their lives. They refuse to surrender.

The firefight begins. Shelling starts—heavy weaponry targets the settlement's defensive turrets. Then infantry combat erupts. The followers take cover, returning fire on the well-armed attackers. The battle rages for hours.

## The Decision to Awaken

The settlement leader realizes they cannot hold out against such superior firepower. With a heavy heart, he tells the alien's assistant: "Listen, we're not managing. We basically screwed up our mission, the mission that Cleopatra gave us. We couldn't uphold our honor. Go to Amun-Ra, wake him up, and may he be with you."

The assistant runs toward the tomb. Enemy infantry breaks through the security systems, pursuing her. They want to capture her. She reaches the tomb and activates the awakening system.

## The Catastrophic Malfunction

As the assistant activates the awakening procedure, the enemy begins blasting the tomb gates to break through. During the battle, one of the projectiles strikes the tomb itself.

The impact damages the hibernation systems—the mechanisms designed to safely bring the alien out of stasis and restore life functions to both the living suit and the alien himself. After 2000 years, the ancient systems were already fragile. Now they begin to malfunction.

Instead of a controlled awakening, it glitches and starts slowly collecting thermal energy from the surrounding environment. Over the next roughly 15 minutes, energy accumulates far beyond what the system was designed to handle.

## The Freezing Begins

The temperature starts dropping. First, the people inside the tomb—the enemy soldiers who broke through—feel the biting cold. They do not freeze instantly; they try to retreat and find a safer place, but the cold is inescapable and they cannot get far enough in time.

The settlement leader, still fighting, begins saving people. He closes some survivors in protective capsules to shield them from the freezing temperatures. Some will survive this way.

The cold spreads further. People in the settlement start shivering, desperately seeking shelter—but there is nowhere safe enough to hide. The temperature continues to drop. People try to find cover but ultimately freeze and die.

The cold reaches the attackers. The secret organization's soldiers begin freezing—they too scramble for protection but cannot escape the spreading cold. Their antagonist leader realizes something has gone catastrophically wrong. He quickly hides inside military equipment to survive, understanding that if he doesn't take shelter now, he'll die too.

## The Hurricane

The thermal energy drain creates a massive atmospheric anomaly. Meteorologists around the world detect something impossible: in the middle of a hot desert, a freezing hurricane vortex begins to form.

The vortex spins with a diameter of 15 kilometers around the epicenter. The temperature drops to minus 200 degrees Celsius. A terrible storm rages—no sunlight penetrates the vortex, and powerful lightning flashes constantly due to the massive temperature imbalance.

## The Teleportation

At the peak of the energy drain, the capsule breaks through to the surface, rising approximately 10 meters above the ground—a massive, ancient structure now visible to all.

After roughly 15 minutes of accumulation, the energy reaches a critical threshold in one single point around the pod. The massive energy surge. This causes uncontrollable chaotic teleportation anomaly. The pod sucked into a hole, vanishing into an unknown dimension.

## Aftermath

The final shot: everything is frozen. Frozen people—settlers and attackers alike. Frozen military equipment. Frozen water. The entire area is a wasteland of ice in the middle of the desert.

The battle is over. The alien is gone, teleported to an unknown location. Most are dead, frozen solid. Only a few survive—the settlement leader, a couple of other side characters, and the antagonist who hid in his equipment.

## Post-Battle Events

After 12 days, the capsule reappears in the middle of a huge metropolis. A deafening sonic boom occurs, blowing out windows in a large radius. The capsule crashes into the ground, breaking through the sewage system and creating a crater.

The alien manages to hide in the sewers. To cover his tracks as best they could, the assistant initiates the capsule's biomass decomposition process—it melts and drains into the sewer system, leaving only a frame behind in the crater for authorities to discover.
