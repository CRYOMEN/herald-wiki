# Game Sheet - Template

Use this file as the master plan/template for the game (or story) as a whole. Fill or update sections as the project develops.

## 1. Overview

- **Title:** Herald - The Awakening
- **Tagline:** TBD
- **Logline:** An alien herald who once lived as a god in Ancient Egypt wakes in 2070 and must warn humanity about an approaching cosmic threat—but in a world without pharaohs or slaves, he must first learn who to trust and find friends. His [Homeworld](Homeworld.md) is dying; his mission is to find a way to save both worlds.
- **Premise:** An alien herald wakes in 2070 to warn Earth of a [cosmic threat](Homeworld.md) that already began destroying his homeworld. The game is built on betrayal, friendship, and love: humanity has changed—no slaves, no pharaohs—and he must navigate this new world, find allies and friends, and ultimately discover how to save both his civilization and ours.
- **Story answers / big questions:** This story offers a unified theory of mythology - an in-world explanation for: why dragons appeared in mythology across cultures; why the mythology of different countries and continents looks the way we know it today (each herald landed in a different region affecting different regional mythologies); why humanity and civilizations developed the way we know today; and why ancient unconnected cultures all have stories of dragons and hybrid beasts (centaurs, werewolves, minotaurs, Naga, Tengu, etc.). The story reframes all of human history: we spent thousands of years worshipping the messengers, fighting wars over their magic and legacy, and completely missed the message.
