- **Logline:** An alien herald who once lived as a god in Ancient Egypt wakes in 2070 and must warn humanity about an approaching cosmic threat—but in a world without pharaohs or slaves, he must first learn who to trust and find friends.

- **Premise:** An alien herald wakes in 2070 to warn Earth of a cosmic threat that already began destroying his homeworld.
