So now let's talk a bit about the appearance of the herald itself. I mean, imagine that it's without its suit. And let's think about how it might actually look.

So they create their suits with a distinctive, non-humanoid form—powerful build, multiple limbs (sometimes four, sometimes two). And at the same time, the herald creates humanoids on Earth. That is, it creates a werewolf, it creates a minotaur, creates a human that looks like a horse - I mean with a horse's head, let's say, right? But it never creates just regular people, other humans. Maybe it did create such people somewhere in history, but like, right now we don't have this recorded anywhere, yet.

And as we know, everything that we humans create, is kind of reflected in who we really are. I mean, we humans, we're simply humanoids, we walk on two legs, we have arms. Our arms are relatively underdeveloped compared to our legs. We have a head, but we don't have the same appendages as their suits.

And they create these suits, these exoskeletons with a distinctive form. Why that form? Maybe because their own bodies are somewhat similar—maybe they use multiple limbs, or maybe they designed the suit that way for mobility.

I mean, our cars and buses are also on four wheels, they don't roll on two wheels, right? That's also worth thinking about. But the one thing we can say for sure is that they themselves don't look like humans at all. And they don't look like the "classic" alien either—huge eyes and so on. They most likely look like beasts, like animals. They're bigger in size, naturally, bigger than people, bigger than a human.

So yeah. That's what you need to keep in mind if we start talking about alien species.
