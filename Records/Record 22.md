So now, what actually happens when the teleportation occurs? I mean, we have the battle, right? Everyone freezes. The capsule appears and it teleports to nowhere.

Some time passes. During this time, news spreads around the world that such an anomaly occurred in the desert, and people froze, died there, they had a battle and so on. I mean, this topic gets extensively covered in the news. People all over the world were in shock. Naturally, the Egyptian authorities cordon off this massive territory to conduct their investigations into why this happened, they invite some other scientists from outside.

And after 12 days, this capsule where our alien is located appears in a huge metropolis. I mean, again, teleportation, but now into a city, right? A small explosion occurs, blows out windows in neighboring buildings, and this capsule crashes into the ground. This capsule crashes into the ground so hard that a small crater forms.

And at some point chaos happens, because nobody understands why this even appeared here. Naturally, the authorities of this city, this country where the city is located, also cordon off this area to understand what this is. And nobody knows yet that this is actually a alien. Absolutely. The alien is inside this capsule, right?

But the alien wakes up completely. And he starts hiding. He starts hiding in the sewage system, I mean in the sewers, in the sewer system. I mean, the thing is that this capsule breaks through this sewer system from above, an entrance forms, and through this entrance the alien goes in there. I mean, actually, nobody on the surface saw him.

Since the alien hasn't fully recovered from hibernation yet, to cover his tracks, the exoskeleton's assistant initiates the biomass decomposition process of the capsule. It starts melting and quickly draining into the sewers. The capsule itself starts this mode that decomposes this capsule. I mean, the capsule also starts penetrating into the sewer system. Only a certain frame remains, lying in the crater, which these people will then see. I mean, this is very important to know. This was done on purpose by the assistant so that nobody would find out about the alien.

Naturally, the authorities of the country where this capsule landed, they cordon off this place, don't let residents get close, but residents can still somehow photograph it from afar, right? But they don't let them get close, like: "No, don't approach, this is an authorities' action zone. We'll figure out what's what here ourselves."

And the authorities themselves also start investigating: "What is this anyway? What fell on us? Does this have some kind of extraterrestrial origin, did something come from another planet, or is this just some meteorite that fell?" I mean, at some point they also start understanding what's what. I mean, they don't understand that it's a alien, but they understand that this has an extraterrestrial origin, right?

Now imagine that we now have two organizations. One country where this capsule fell, many countries that would also like to find out what this is there. They ask this country and somehow interact a little, scientists interact as well. They start investigations.
