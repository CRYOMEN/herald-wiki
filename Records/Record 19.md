So, as you know, the idea was that a secret organization attacks the settlement, the people from the settlement can't repel the attack, and they decide to wake the herald, who teleports to nowhere. Right? That's the general idea.

The thing is, there's one aspect here that might be interesting. And I'm talking about showing the life of these people who live in the settlement. I mean, these followers of Cleopatra, right? What do they live for? What are their thoughts? What are their problems? What are their dreams, right? Maybe young people dream of going somewhere else, to another place, I don't know, to study, to work, right? Things like that.

So we need to create, maybe, something fun when they interact with each other. Maybe some small drama, right? I mean, say, some people say: "Listen, I don't want to live here. Why the hell are we even sitting here, vegetating in this godforsaken place?" Things like that.

Well, and along the way, we can show their culture. I mean, how they live. Naturally, imagine, it's 2070, right? Obviously, globalization affects everything. I mean, connectivity, globalization—all this affects the unification of cultures, the unification of how people live in different parts of the planet, right? Same thing there. I mean, they know perfectly well that yes, these technologies exist, they these too. There's such and such music. Such and such movies, games and so on.

I mean, all these things—it's completely different from how it was in Ancient Egypt, right? But here they're already just ordinary people.

But they also have several features. The first feature is the presence of monsters among people. I mean, those  monsters descendants that our herald created. These monsters are "like" divine beings. Strong, powerful, healthy, huge, much taller than people, with claws, with fangs, some with scales, some with fur, with such eyes, really wild.

It's important to understand that monsters are not immortal. They also die. Life expectancy varies for different forms. Very few monsters live in the settlement, but they definitely exist. All species of this kind survived to our time through reproduction with people.

Monsters can talk. I mean, they converse with these people, interact. And obviously, they interract somehow. But here's what's important—monsters can reproduce by copulating with humans. All monsters are only male. Pregnancy from monsters is rare, but possible, so their numbers are small.

People and monsters keep a secret of monsters existance. I mean, they don't want the outside world to know about them. And here's how they manage to keep this fact secret: the monsters were able to synthesize memory erasure technology or erase specific parts of it. So if someone from the outside world sees the monsters, they can erase that memory. Or, if somebody wants to leave the community, pat of memory about monsters will be erased. This solves the secrecy problem.

After the battle a few will survive. The settlement leader will survive. A couple of other side characters will survive, we'll show them later in the second chapter. The antagonist from the secret organization will survive. Everyone else dies.

What happens after the monsters die? The monsters die and decompose quickly, but biomass remains after them. This is a technical feature of artificially created life forms.
