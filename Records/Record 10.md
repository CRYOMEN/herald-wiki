So, information about the secret organization that hunts for alien technologies. It was founded back in Ancient Egypt, when aliens were just beginning to arrive on Earth from another galaxy.

I mean, why was it formed? There were people who considered aliens their gods. For example, our main protagonist—people thought he was actually Amun Ra. Some considered them as friends. But other people wanted power. They wanted power, they wanted strength. And naturally, they saw that if they seized these aliens technologies and artifacts, they would become, well, basically almost all-powerful.

And now it's the year 2070, and this organization is now also a high-tech organization, it has a lot of money, resources, but they still hunt for alien technologies to become even stronger. They hunt for their artifacts, for alien artifacts, for the alien bestiary, because aliens can create monsters, various kinds of beasts using their living suits as mobile laboratories that can mix DNA of different creatures and create new species. For example, our hero created Anubis this way. People saw the living creature and started worshiping it. There was also a werewolf, a minotaur, all kinds of mythical creatures like unicorns, Medusa, and so on.

And they've just found our alien. A jackpot! He's currently sleeping. So so one of these heralds is currently sleeping, and he's supposed to sleep for several hundred more years, supposedly, but they find him. Or rather, they find his location, they find where he's hidden. There's a special tomb in the sands, in the desert.

And in this desert there's also a settlement of people, followers, the so-called followers of Cleopatra. They guard this alien, they guard this place where he's buried. Moreover, not everyone in the settlement knows about this place. I mean, they don't quite understand why they're here. Obviously, the followers are just ordinary people. I mean, many generations of people have changed here already. And only the chosen ones know the true reason why they guard this alien here, why they're even in this place, why this settlement was formed. They're here with their families, children, wives and so on.

They have their own small army, at least something. Obviously, over such a long period of time, the resources, the financial resources of the followers are already, well, practically nothing. They can't acquire proper weapons to resist such attacks from the outside. Well, naturally, they do some kind of business, I mean somehow people there, well, live.
