She runs to this alien. The infantry that's breaking through the security systems runs after her. They want to capture her. She runs into tomb. She runs in there, activates the system that will wake this alien up. The system starts activating.

And those bad guys start blowing up this tomb. Yes, to break in there, they blow up the gates. The system gets damaged. And because of the malfunction, an incorrect alien awakening process begins. I mean, the system starts draining thermal energy from the environment. Accordingly, the environment starts cooling down.

Very strong cold freezing air appears. The people who ran in with assault rifles to where the herald sleeps, they  freeze. But the cold temperature then slowly spreads to the settlement. People start freezing, we'll need to show this, how they're freezing, I mean they're freezing, they're cold, and there's nowhere to hide.

The settlement leader starts saving people (while battling the foes), closes some people in some kind of capsules so they can survive there. I mean, we'll show this too, I mean some people will survive there.

And then this absence of energy, thermal energy, it spreads further, further, further, then to the invaders themselves, they also freeze. The secret organization antagonist also hides in the equipment to survive. He understands that something went wrong. If he doesn't hide now, things are bad for him.

And at some point we'll switch to a cutscene. This cutscene will show meteorologists, they'll see this anomaly. Well, imagine, I mean we have this hot desert with sand, and there suddenly unexpectedly forms a cold, cold, minus, I don't know, like 200 degrees cold air hurricane flow that spins like a vortex. Imagine, we'll need to show this on screen. They'll say: "Oh my God, what's even happening there?"

And let's say, there, I don't know, with a radius of, I don't know, 10 km, 15 km this hurricane will be spinning there. And at some point we switch back to the main scene-everything's frozen there, there's a huge strong hurricane. No sun, naturally. Terrible strong lightning flashes, because such a big temperature imbalance is happening.

And at some point the capsule breaks through to the surface from the enormous amount of energy, above the earth's surface. I mean, maybe 10 meters above the surface, I mean a huge thing like that. And at some point it disappears. Poof. And that's it. It teleported, it teleported to an unknown space.

I mean, for the player it will look like this capsule just disappeared with some kind of special teleportation effect, and that's it. I mean, for us the most important thing is to intrigue the player. Intrigue the player that, this happened. And that's it. The scene ends there, and that's enough.
