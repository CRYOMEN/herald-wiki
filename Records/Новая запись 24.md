There was a young woman during Cleopatra's time. Cleopatra gives this woman to the herald as a great gift to be sacrificed to him as a god, or to have her as a slave or servant. I mean, he could have just eaten her. But he decides not to eat her, he simply falls in love with her.

And when the herald goes to sleep to wake up in 2070, this woman, obviously, has great love for the alien, but she can't do anything. I mean, it's clear that she'll grow old someday, and she'll also die, right, quite quickly already.

In three years after Cleopatra's death she uses the herald's technology to create a special artifact and also to modify herself DNA. I mean, modify herself in such a way that subsequent generations—her children, then her grandchildren and so on—they could use it if they connect with this artifact in a certain way. All her thoughts, all her desires, memories, feelings for this herald—they awaken in a special way in that person, I mean in her descendants.

And by the way, in 2070 her descendant lives—a woman named Jasmine.
