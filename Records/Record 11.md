So anyway, this secret organization finally finds where the alien is buried. And they decide to open this sarcophagus and take it either alive or dead. They want to take its technology.

They find it, they know that it's being guarded by people from a settlement. Naturally, then these bad guys, I mean from the organization, they arrive with their tanks, with their infantry, to this settlement and start shelling it. There might be some negotiations, like: "Well, guys, we came here, we're stronger than you. Come on, hand it over, we know who you're guarding here, give us your alien, and you won't get hurt."

But obviously, Cleopatra's followers are loyal to Cleopatra, even after thousands of years. More than 2000 years ago, she gave the order to her subjects to guard the alien, to keep its location secret, at the cost of their lives.

And the confrontation begins, a firefight starts. And we need to show this firefight scene, we need to show how they're in cover, how they're opening fire on the enemy.

And at some point the leader of this settlement says: "Guys, we can't stand against well-armed people. We need to get the herald out of here." And a decision is made to wake the alien up so it can escape this place. They send the alien's assistant to it. The assistant activates the awakening procedure, so that the herald starts to wake up.

But something goes wrong. During the battle, one of the projectiles hits the tomb. The systems for bringing it out of hibernation and restoring the life functions of the living suit and the hero himself get damaged. The capsule continues its work with malfunctions. This system starts glitching. Because after all, 2000 years have passed. Obviously, nothing lasts forever.

An aggressive collection of thermal energy from the surrounding space begins. It starts draining energy. I mean, it actually still needed this energy, but it started draining it quickly. As a result, everything around starts freezing. A powerful hurricane begins, a vortex forms with a diameter of 15 kilometers around the epicenter, the temperature gradually drops to minus 200 degrees.

And gradually, I mean first we'll show the settlement freezing, people there are already shivering from the cold, then the soldiers who attacked them freeze too. And gradually this capsule disappears from the sarcophagus. I mean, it will most likely appear on the surface so we can show this in the visuals.

At its peak, a huge amount of energy causes a teleportation anomaly to an unknown dimension. 

And the last shot we'll show there is frozen people, frozen equipment, frozen water and so on. And that's it. That's all for now in this scene.

Later, in the narrative, the teleportation ends after 12 days, and the capsule appears in the middle of a huge metropolis. A sonic boom occurs, blowing out windows in a large radius around buildings. The capsule crashes into the ground, breaks through the sewage system where the alien will later hide, and a crater forms around the capsule.
