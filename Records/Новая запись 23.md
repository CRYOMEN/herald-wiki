One more very interesting point regarding the herald, regarding his exoskeleton, I mean his living suit. And the energy that this suit loses.

The thing is that during the period when he arrived on Earth, in Ancient Egypt, after some time he found an interesting feature of this exoskeleton and of himself, by the way. The thing is that this is a story about love, about friendship, about betrayal.

And this alien fell in love several times. Fell in love and had mental and intimate connection with humans, with women. Well, imagine, the alien is there, he constantly sees all these people, and he falls in love. And a connection happens between them. A love connection, a physical connection.

And this connection increased the energy of the suit itself. It was in this way that he somehow managed to extend his mission in Ancient Egypt a bit.
