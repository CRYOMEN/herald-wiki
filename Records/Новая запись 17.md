So, one more thing I forgot about our alien's suit. The thing is, this suit doesn't operate by itself. It has an assistant. Specifically for this suit. I mean, it's a special feature of alien suits.

So this assistant allows for taking special measurements of this suit, it allows for detaching from the suit, being a separate unit. And this assistant—it's also alive, it's a living creature, and it can already think, it has fears, worries, emotions, possesses some knowledge, can acquire additional knowledge, can speak.

And this assistant is always loyal, 100% loyal to whoever is currently sitting inside the suit. In our case, this is our herald, right? So he sits inside the suit. Accordingly, this assistant is 100% loyal to him.

And when our alien is buried under the sands, right, I mean there will be some kind of tomb, this assistant basically lives a little separately and lives together with the settlers, together with the so-called followers of Cleopatra. I mean, these followers know about this assistant, they constantly talk with her, joke, play. Well, basically, just ordinary friendly, very warm friendly connections.

Naturally, this assistant has seen many generations of these people, because as we know, they've been living here for more than 2000 years, guarding our alien, right? Naturally, she saw how these people are born, how they live, how they die. And she has some kind of sadness about this, because people live so short.

But nevertheless, since she sees these people from birth, these people trust her very much. And she also trusts them 100%.

In our plot, before the battle, she's just walking around somewhere. Just walking around like... scout, like, well, a person who is outside the settlement, right, keeping a sharp lookout, I mean, so that no one is there, right, I mean something like that.

And so she notices that there's some movement. Military equipment is moving toward our settlement. And right here we will most likely start showing our scene, how she sees how this equipment is moving, knows that this isn't just equipment passing by, they're moving with bad intentions toward the settlement.

She quickly runs to warn them. She runs to warn people, runs into the settlement, runs to this leader of this settlement, says: "Listen, bad news, some equipment is moving toward us."

The settlement leader is very surprised: "How so, why didn't our probes, sensors work, why didn't they detect these people?" Quickly everyone mobilizes as fast as possible. Weapons are distributed to everyone. They pull out some heavy weaponry too.

Many wives and husbands who didn't know, don't know about what's actually happening, they're very surprised, but the people who are followers of Cleopatra say: "Listen, hide. Everything is very bad, there's going to be a big confrontation."

So this is the beginning of this story. 

And the battle begins. The shelling of the settlement starts, shelling specifically of these turrets, heavy weaponry. Then combat begins between the infantries.

And at some point, in a few hours, the settlement leader realizes they can't handle the well-armed people. And with a heavy heart he tells this assistant: "Listen, we're not managing. We basically screwed up our mission, the mission that Cleopatra gave us. I mean, we couldn't uphold our honor. Go to Amun-Ra, wake him up, and may he be with you."
