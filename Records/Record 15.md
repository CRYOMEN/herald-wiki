So now let's talk a bit about Cleopatra's followers.

Well, we all know Cleopatra, right? Very famous queen of Ancient Egypt, the last of the Ptolemies, if you know, and it was, January 13, 69 BC to August 10/12, 30 BC.

What matters is that during her life, this herald quite often helped her. But then it was decided that he would go to sleep. And as a tribute of respect, as to her friend, because they were very good friends - not just acquaintances, but really close friends - she said: "Okay, guys, Amun-Ra, his tomb must be guarded, because he won't manage alone."

I repeat again, he won't manage alone, because if this secret organization finds him, they'll just kill him and that's it, and they'll seize his technologies. And basically, humanity is in danger because of such people who hunt aliens for their own gain.

And she recruits people, the so-called followers of Cleopatra. These are very loyal people who swore by themselves and their children that they too would guard in secret the place where the herald is buried, where he basically sleeps.

So what do we call them? Cleopatra's followers.

2000 years pass. Cleopatra's followers have formed a settlement in this place. A huge number of generations have changed. And these people still live in this place, but the thing is, not everyone knows that a alien lies in this place.

I mean, these people, these next generations, I mean Cleopatra's followers, have families, right? They just live their normal lives, as we know today, right? I mean, they work somewhere, do something. Someone has a business, someone there, I don't know, teaches someone, someone does some kind of craft. Well, anything can be.

But some of these people know: "Okay, guys, actually our main mission here is to guard. To guard this place in secret. And if God forbid someone finds out about this place, to do everything possible to preserve this herald, because this is the only hope that humanity will survive in the future."
