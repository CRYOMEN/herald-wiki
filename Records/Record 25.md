The bestiary in our story about the herald. Before we start listing the entire bestiary, let's first give some introductory information.

The thing is that not only the herald arrived on planet Earth. There were actually several of these heralds. I mean, several aliens were sent to Earth at different times. And all these aliens, naturally, possessed this suit, this exoskeleton, and they could create new life forms.

The entire bestiary that I'll now list here, you need to keep in mind that they weren't created only by our hero—they were created at different times by different aliens.

So, what do we have?

Human and mammal hybrids:
Usually these are human and mammal hybrids. For example, canines: the werewolf Werewolf—human and wolf; Cynocephalus—human with a dog's head, appeared somewhere in antiquity and the Middle Ages; Anubis—human with a jackal's head, appeared in Ancient Egypt, by the way, was created by our hero; Fenrir Berserker—human-wolf from Scandinavian myths; Inugami—human possessed by a dog spirit, was created in Japan.

From felines: Sphinx—human and lion, was created in Egypt and Greece; Manticore—combination of lion, human, and scorpion; Were Lion—human-lion, werelion; Bastet—human-cat in Egypt; Leoinal—humanoid lion, this is from Dungeons & Dragons fantasy, but such a variant is also possible.

Equines: Centaurs—human and horse. Or reverse centaur—horse with human head or vice versa, human with horse head. Horseman—human body, muscular, and horse head.

Ungulates: Minotaur—human and bull; Satyr—human and goat; Faun—Roman analog of satyr; human-deer—Wendigo-like from North American myths, because some heralds landed in North America; Pan—god with goat horns; human-moose from Siberian folklore.

Other mammals: human-bear Were Bear; human-pig; human-ape, Yeti, Sasquatch; Hanuman—human and monkey from India; human-bat—from modern folklore, can keep in mind; Ganesha—human-elephant.

Human and bird hybrids:
Angel—human with bird wings; Harpy—woman and bird; Siren—woman and bird as early version; Hawkman—human-hawk from comics; human-raven from Celtic myths; Tengu—human and raven in Japan; human-owl.

Marine creatures:
Mermaid—human with fish tail; Nix—water spirit; Selkie—combination of human and seal; human-dolphin; human-shark; human-octopus with tentacles; human-whale; Dagon—human and fish from ancient Semites and Lovecraft.

Human and reptiles:
Very important—Lizardman, will appear very often in our story, our hero created this type of species. Combination of human body and lizard, with lizard head. Naga—human and snake from India; Lamia—woman and snake; Medusa Gorgon; human-crocodile, Sobek—human with crocodile head from Egypt, also was created by our herald; human-turtle.

Insects:
Spider-man—not to be confused with the modern Spider-Man from movies, this is just a combination of human and spider, maybe he has spider limbs instead of legs; Arachne—spider-woman; human-scorpion; human-mantis.

Mixed multi-component hybrids:
Chimera—lion plus goat plus snake; Griffin—lion plus eagle; Manticore; Simurgh; Shedu—human, bull and wings; Lamassu; Seraphim—has many wings, not quite human-like. By the way, our hero's assistant, the assistant specifically of his suit, his exoskeleton, he's somewhat similar, probably, to a Seraphim (many appendages), but there will most likely also be long thick tentacles. We don't know exactly what it will look like yet, but approximately like that. Siphon; Echidna.

Fully zoomorphic but sentient creatures:
Unicorn—remember how it behaves toward virgins, for example. This creature was created in Middle-Ages in England. I mean, yes, you should consider that each of these creatures has some behavioral peculiarities. This is important to know. Pegasus—horse with wings; Phoenix.

As for the alien—they don't make aliens of themselves. I mean, we completely cross it out. The alien in our story appeared only because they essentially came here and their suits gave them a distinctive, imposing form. I mean, they sat in their suits and that form is what people saw.

Also: Cerberus; Hippocampus; Leviathan; Kirin; Qilin.

Other:
Beastfolk. Xenomorph hybrids—essentially what we've been discussing here are xenomorph hybrids by and large. I mean, these are genetic hybrids of human and animal. There can also be human and plant—such a hybrid; human-mushroom can be.

Essentially, these hybrids became gods with zoomorphic forms in people's eyes and werew reflected in they mythology, for example, there are many such gods in Ancient Egypt. Some of them later passed into Greek mythologies.

These things are all very important to know when we talk about this story.
