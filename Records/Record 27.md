It's also very important to remember about this bestiary that these combinations of humans and animals, and also all kinds of unicorns and pegasus there-they were not immortal. They were not immortal at all. At some point they died. The most ordinary age, right, from age, I mean they grow old, they die.

These combinations, these people and animals, right, combinations of people and animals, they actually could  reproduce. But they reproduced only with humans. I mean, well, basically, they had sex with a human, and the human gave birth to precisely, again, this combination, like the same werewolf, right, for example, the same thing.

I mean, for example, a minotaur was born, right, a little minotaur, a little person, I mean he grows, he grows quite quickly, beyond his years, compared to a human. I mean, these kinds of combinations existed.

These were very quite rare cases, and also all these moments of reproduction between a human and a human hybrid, they were kept by society in secret. Not by human society, but by the society of human and mammal hybrids. I mean,  hybrids, these powerful creatures, which were like beasts, they kept all this in secret as much as possible.
