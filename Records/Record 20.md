Now let's talk a bit about the backstory. Why did this alien end up on our planet at all? Where is he from?

He's from another galaxy. There's a so-called binary system of two planets there. The planets are very close to each other, in quite vigorous motion. And our aliens live on these planets.

But when we talk about aliens, you need to keep in mind that they don't look the way we picture them here on Earth. I mean, they don't have the same appendages or features as the suit. They look completely, completely different.

Why do Earth's myths depict them in such different ways? Because the suits vary: one regional variant has a certain build and flight capability, another has a different build and other means of getting around, and so on. Different cultures saw different heralds or different suit configurations.

Because these suits, living suits, exoskeletons, in which the real aliens sit, they're different in shape and look. Some have flight capability; another variation can be without it but has special technology that helps it move through the air. It depends on the herald.

Moreover, these suits can also self-modify within certain limits. For example, the alien sitting inside may decide to change the suit's configuration-reduce appendages, switch to four limbs only, and so on. Those kinds of options.

So, these aliens live on these two planets. They have an advanced civilization, advanced technologies, a kind of artificial intelligence, but it's not quite artificial intelligence. They can create living beings/species that can think, that can desire something, have their own needs, their own dreams. Well, basically, the same living beings as us humans, and so on. I mean, these created living beings just serve them a bit.

And at some point, a threat descends upon these two planets. All life begins to die. There's no exact idea yet of how this happens. I mean, for example, if you remember, in Mass Effect there was this highly advanced civilization that sent collectors to the Milky Way, and they killed everyone. No, it's a bit different here. It might be roughly the same idea, but it's still unknown how it will be.

In any case, what should be taken as fact is that the alien civilization began to die. And all life on these planets began to die. This is important to note.

And the best minds of their civilization, all these scientists, engineers, they learned that actually these two planets they live on are connected to a third planet. These planets are sisters. Two sisters together, and one sister planet separate. And this sister planet is called Earth. This connection is biological, physical, cosmic, and even mental. In the overall plot, all celestial bodies possess consciousness.

So they realized that after these two sisters, this threat will fly to Earth and will also kill everyone there. And they decide to warn humanity and possibly even give them a chance, give them resistance, find a solution to this problem and survive.

They find the very best of the best on their two planets, the chosen ones who can fly to Earth. They begin sending these heralds. So several so-called heralds were sent. I mean, herald-that's a messenger, right.

And it happened that one of the heralds, quite young, an inexperienced adult, is so impulsive, so naive, but he was so moved by this idea that humanity on Earth must be saved, that he also crawls, climbs without permission into this suit and sends himself to Earth. Contrary to how it should have actually happened, because a completely different alien was supposed to fly instead of him, one who was chosen for this.

So the idea is that when our protagonist, the herald, arrives on Earth, he's still young and inexperienced. He's impulsive, nothing can stop him. I mean, he actually knows very little. I mean, yes, he has a suit, powerful technology that can do literally almost everything, probably, compared to humans, right?

He arrives, and he knows what the mission is. I mean, he needs to warn people about this threat, but it doesn't work. He arrives in Ancient Egypt. I mean, when he was on these two planets at home, everyone there said: "Okay, guys, where we're flying now, the people there are already highly developed. Maybe even more developed than we are. They'll definitely find this solution. This is our goal, this is our hope. These people are our hope to save ourselves, to save us."

But when he arrives on the planet, he ends up in Ancient Egypt. I mean, the people are so undeveloped. He arrives, and he's surprised: "Guys, where are your technologies at all?" He says: "Okay, fine. I'll stay here and develop you. You don't know writing, you don't know music or something else. I mean, we'll build a state, and you'll develop. And then we'll find a way to resist this threat."

But young and inexperienced is young and inexperienced, right? After 1000 years, even more, he realizes that everything isn't going as he assumed, as he wanted. I mean, he's grown up a bit, obviously, he's gained some additional knowledge from his assistant, because the assistant also knows a lot about technology, and basically, he just taught him.

And he decides that since the suit's precious energy is running out, something needs to be done urgently. The resource is running out, something needs to be done urgently. And he understands that humanity will develop anyway, you just have to wait. You have to wait until they develop their technologies.

And he decides to go into hibernation. When this suit sleeps, much less energy is spent. And he calculated that this energy would be quite enough to then end up somewhere in the distant future, when people will already know a lot, will have gathered a lot of knowledge, when they'll have good technologies, and then he'll be able to help them. I mean, he'll give them this message that this threat is coming here that will destroy all life on Earth. And he goes into hibernation during the reign of Cleopatra.
