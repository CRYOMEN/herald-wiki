So now we need to talk a bit about technologies-the technologies that humanity has and the technologies that aliens have.

Let's probably start with humanity's technologies. So it's the year 2070. Дet's imagine humanity in 2070. Well, they naturally have artificial intelligence, much more advanced than now. I mean, this is most likely artificial intelligence that can truly be self-aware, understand itself, express thoughts, and can even autonomously do things. There are robots. I mean, platforms that this artificial intelligence can control. So basically, humanity is tied to hardware, to silicon. Technologies are robots made of metal, right? I mean, made of metal, some composite materials, running on electricity. Same thing, the brains of artificial intelligence-this is basically a computer, this is also metal for us, some composite materials and some stones, because it's all made from stones, right? I mean, something very solid like that.

What technologies do aliens have? Aliens have different technologies. They're tied to bioengineering. I mean, they are excellent experts in how the body works, how body cells function, how to build these bodies, how to develop these bodies. And it's on the basis of this knowledge that we build our story, our narrative.

So our main protagonist arrives on Earth not empty-handed, he arrives on Earth with biotechnologies. He arrived much, much earlier-in the times of Ancient Egypt, when the pyramids hadn't been built yet, when in mythology the gods Amun and Ra hadn't been unified yet.

The story begins with his Homeworld, which began to die. This is a cosmic threat that is now heading toward Earth. Our hero's mission is to warn humanity and find a solution to resist the extinction of both worlds.

All this time he was awake right up until approximately 32-33 BC (two to three years before Cleopatra's death), to help humanity make a technological leap in development as quickly as possible. Then he goes into hibernation to conserve the suit's energy and to wake up according to plan around the year 2200. But as you already know, the plan didn't work out.

And he is enclosed in a Living Suit. I mean, it's a living organism, right? I mean, it's an exoskeleton, but it's alive. I mean, also an additional body. So basically, our alien sits inside this suit, and this suit has a distinctive, imposing form-powerful build, multiple limbs, prominent head and jaw; the exact shape varies by herald, and some variants can fly.

So what we know about these aliens is actually what we know about how their exoskeleton looks.

Ho do we people create exoskeletons? Also something strong. Also a person sits inside, in a cockpit, but the exoskeleton is made of metal, of iron, runs on fuel, right? I mean, you understand, right?

And how does a alien's exoskeleton work? It just eats someone, the exoskeleton digests the food, and this food turns into energy and into some additional cells so that this exoskeleton heals itself, right? I mean, so it can be repaired. That's the idea.

And another very main feature of our alien's exoskeleton-this exoskeleton can create other life forms. It can create a dog if it sees this dog, of course. But it can create some special life form based on a dog, plus there, I don't know, a cow, plus something else, I mean some kind of hybrids. Maybe it will come up with something of its own, like adding flight surfaces or other appendages, let's say.

So our protagonist created many such beasts during all his time living on Earth. Let's call them monsters, beasts, right? I mean, one of the most famous is the Werewolf species, I mean it's a human-werewolf, with a wolf's head. Then the Minotaur species, also with a human body but with a buffalo's head, a bull. Then there was also Anubis. He was also created by our protagonist in Ancient Egypt, and people started calling Anubis their god because they saw how strong Anubis was.

And at some point he even created armies of beasts. These armies fought and helped, but were used very rarely to keep their existence secret from the whole world. For example, in the narrative there was a very interesting episode when one of the heralds became an antagonist-Apophis. Our hero and Egypt in general had a hard time with him. They had to create armies to defend against Apophis's minions.

What's important to remember? When he creates these beasts, part of a special energy of his exoskeleton, his Living Suit, is lost and very hard to recharge. This is important to remember. That's exactly why he wanted to go to sleep, so that later he could end up somewhere in the future and wake up again, because the special energy of this suit was being spent, and he couldn't spend it anymore, right? Because, well, then his mission wouldn't be completed.

What was his mission? He arrived on Earth, he needed to warn people about the danger that was moving toward their planet-that very cosmic threat that destroyed his home world. This is very important to know. So why did he go to sleep? Because the special energy was running out, and on the remains of the last energy he decided: "Okay, guys, I'll go to sleep, I'll wake up in more than 2000 years in 2200, and then with the remaining energy we'll think about how to repel this danger to Earth."

Well, as you know, it all didn't go according to plan.
