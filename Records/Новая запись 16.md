So, well, let's probably talk about ideas for how the events we want to show will unfold.

So we'll have a confrontation between Cleopatra's followers and the secret organization. We have a protagonist and antagonist there, I mean two sides. So our protagonist will be the leader of this settlement.

And the antagonist will be such a loyal dog of this secret organization. I mean, he'll be somewhat similar in character to that guy Colonel Miles Quaritch from the first and second Avatar.

So it turns out that when this organization attacks, first there will probably be some kind of dialogue. Like: "Guys, you can't handle us, surrender. We only need this place."

And, as you know, not all people know at all what these bad guys are talking about. They start asking questions, right? So it turns out that actually they have some kind of their own mission here.
