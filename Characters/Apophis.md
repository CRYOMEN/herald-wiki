# Character Sheet — Apophis

## 1. Identity

- **Name:** TBD.

- **Type:** Dragon.
- **Role:** Antagonist — a rival herald who went rogue.
- **Demographics (optional):** Age unknown. Gender: male.

## 2. Physical

- **Voice/speech (optional):** TBD.
- **Morphology (if hybrid/alien):** Serpentine Living Suit variant. Details TBD.

## 3. Psychological / temperament

- **Personality:** TBD.
- **Drives:** TBD — whether he wanted to rule Earth, believed humanity was a lost cause, or had other reasons. His actions were clearly hostile: he sought to tear down everything [Alekandras](Alekandras.md) was building.
- **Fears:** TBD.
- **Flaws / weaknesses:** TBD.
- **Secrets or hidden need:** TBD.
- **Notable habits:** TBD.

## 4. Backstory

- **Origin:** The [Homeworld](../Homeworld.md) — the binary planet system.
- **Key past events:** Went rogue — the heralds were not a monolith; they had politics and disagreements. While [Alekandras](Alekandras.md) tried to guide humanity to build a civilization capable of resisting the threat, Apophis turned hostile. He created armies of serpent monsters and other beasts — designed to destroy everything [Alekandras](Alekandras.md) was building.  [Alekandras](Alekandras.md) won, but only drove Apophis into hiding — not a definitive kill. Apophis's current status is unknown.
- **Ties to the world:** His creations (serpent creatures, other beasts) may still exist. His conflict with [Alekandras](Alekandras.md) shaped the Egyptian mythology of Ra vs. Apophis (sun vs. chaos).

## 5. Relationships

- **Allies:** His own minions.
- **Enemies:** [Alekandras](Alekandras.md). Potentially other aliens.
- **Dependents / others:** Unknown.
- **Public perception (optional):** Ancient Egypt: the great serpent, the ultimate enemy of Ra, the embodiment of chaos. In mythology he tries to swallow the sun every night — this was the human interpretation of the real conflict.

## 6. Abilities and equipment

- **Skills:** Same general capabilities as other aliens through the Living Suit: life-form creation (bestiary), biotech, self-modification, attack capabilities.
- **Weapons / gear:** His exoskeleton suit (serpentine variant).
- **Special capabilities:** TBD.

## 7. Story usage

- **Appearances:** [Alekandras](Alekandras.md) vs Apophis war. His current status (hiding, hibernating, dead) is TBD.
- **Plot function:** Primary ancient antagonist — his war with [Alekandras](Alekandras.md) forced both to drain special energy of their suits. His conflict is the reason the Egyptian mythology of Ra vs. Apophis exists.
- **Possible arcs:** Could return during the 2070 timeline (was driven into hiding, not killed). Could ally with or be exploited by the secret organization. His surviving creations could play a role. TBD.
- **Archetype (optional):** Shadow / rival; the enemy within (a fellow herald turned hostile).
