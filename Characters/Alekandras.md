## 4. Backstory

- **Origin:** The [Homeworld](../Homeworld.md) — a binary planet system in another galaxy.
- **Key past events:** Childhood (in the binary system). Stole the suit and left for Earth (he was not the chosen herald). Arrival in Ancient Egypt. First contact with people on Earth. A god by an accident in the eyes of the people. Battle with [Apophis](Apophis.md) and his minions — a biomech civil war in the Nile Valley; Alekandras (Amun-Ra) won but only drove Apophis into hiding, not a definitive kill; the war drained his special energy to low levels. Intimate connection with several human women during his life in Egypt; intimate connection with [Cleopatra](Cleopatra%20VII.md) and her concubine/slave [Iras](Iras.md). Decision to hibernate — he calculated that in ~2,000 years humanity would reach a silicon era capable of understanding his message, targeting wake-up around 2200 (during Cleopatra’s reign, before her death). Awakening in 2070 (malfunction, accident teleportation, then metropolis — 130 years too early). After crashing in the metropolis, he hides in the sewers.
- **Ties to the world:** (Skipped for now.)

## 5. Relationships

- **Allies:** Some pharaohs. [Iko](Iko.md). Followers of [Cleopatra](Cleopatra%20VII.md). Most of his minions/creatures created with the suit (e.g. Anubis, Sobek). [Jasmine](Jasmine.md) (eventual ally).
- **Enemies:** [Apophis](Apophis.md). Possibly governments. The [secret organization](Secret%20Organization%20Leader.md).
- **Dependents / others:** Pharaohs. TBD.
- **Public perception (optional):** Ancient Egypt: god Amun-Ra; worshipers, pharaohs, strangers saw him as divine — the zoomorphic gods (figures with animal heads) were literal physical descriptions of the suits. In 2070: dragons are mythical creatures in the eyes of the world — but he is a dragon in reality (hidden and unknown to the public).

## 6. Abilities and equipment

- **Skills:** Mostly through the **Living Suit** (see Technology): life-form creation (DNA mixing, bestiary); biotech and healing; self-modification (e.g. limb configuration); flight (if suit variant has it); attack with claws, tail, horns; thick scaly form; great strength; high intelligence and speech; long-lived.
- **Weapons / gear:** None (no human tech or tools). His “weapons” are mainly the Living Suit and its tech.
- **Special capabilities:** Life-form creation (DNA mixing, bestiary; consumes special energy). Self-modification (suit can change configuration within limits, e.g. limb count). Biomass decomposition. See Technology, Bestiary.

## 7. Story usage

- **Appearances:** One of the main characters—appears almost everywhere. 
- **Plot function:** Protagonist; warn and save humanity from the cosmic threat; messenger from his dying civilization. In Ancient Egypt: god, teacher, defender (e.g. battle with Apophis). After awakening: hide, recover, find allies and friends, eventually deliver the message.
- **Possible arcs:** Hidden functions in the suit (discovery). Conflict with the secret organization. Meeting his old friend [Arturas](Arturas.md). First signs that the threat to Earth is very close. Finding the reason why he mistakenly arrived in Ancient Egypt instead of a more advanced era. **Important:** After crashing in the metropolis in 2070, the hero knows nothing about Jasmine. He also does not know that [Iras](Iras.md) modified her own DNA after his hibernation.
- **Archetype (optional):** Protagonist; messenger / herald.

## 8. Notes

- TBD (quotes, timeline, cross-references to Battle Scene, Bestiary, Technology).
