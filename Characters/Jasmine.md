- **Personality:** Shy and insecure in daily life; playful and lighthearted once she trusts someone. Kind, compassionate, down-to-earth; helps others sometimes to her detriment. Model student, determined and ambitious beneath a fragile appearance. Introspective; can confront her own desires and darker feelings.

- **Flaws / weaknesses:** Vulnerable to manipulation and strong personalities; obedient/submissive tendency in the face of dominant figures; can put others’ needs before her own to her detriment.
- **Secrets or hidden need:** Double life as a nightclub dancer (masked, sensual performances); attraction to dominant figures; need for validation and intimacy.
- **Notable habits:** *Daily routines — School:* Conservative, efficient prep (neat clothes, minimal makeup, bag ready the night before); may review notes or help at home before leaving.
*Nightclub:* Deliberate transformation into Scarlett: mask, exposed outfit (chains/silks), hair and posture shift; she is turned on by the danger of others’s attention.
*Physical quirks:* Plays with her hair, avoids eye contact, fidgets (hands, hem, jewellery). Often slips into a subtly deferential, obedient demeanor -  feels an inherited pull toward yielding or pleasing others.
*Tells:* When lying or hiding something: fidgeting increases, can’t hold eye contact, voice drops or trails off.
