# The Homeworld - Reference

## 1. Overview

- **Location:** Another galaxy, far from Earth.
- **System:** A binary planet system orbiting a single sun - two planets sharing one star.
- **Nature:** The Homeworld is a living, thriving biosphere - the origin of aliens culture.
- **Current status:** Dying. The binary system is being consumed by the cosmic threat (see below). The Heralds launched missions to Earth - in a desperate effort to outrun and eventually counter this extinction.

## 2. The Sister Planet Theory

The aliens did not stumble upon Earth by accident. Their scientists discovered that their planets possess a kind of resonance - a specific vibrational or even biological frequency, like a tuning fork - with something outside of their solar system. Like if they connecting or "speaking" to something. They found a planet that was "singing" on the same frequency as their own dying world. It was Earth. And it was not just habitable; it was a sister to their own planets - biologically and even mentally connected.

Because the planets are sisters, the life that evolves on them shares a compatible evolutionary path. This is why aliens biology is compatible with terrestrial life.

This reframes the alien arrival: the aliens did not come to conquer. They came to find a possible way to save binary system which was dying - consumed by the cosmic threat - and they sent so called "heralds" to jump across the void, arrive on Earth, and help unite with humanity to build a defense before the threat reaches here.

## 3. The Cosmic Threat

An extinction-level event that consumes entire planetary systems. The exact nature is unspecified - it could be a predatory species, a pathogen, or some kind of dark matter phenomenon - but the effect is clear: it destroyed the aliens' binary system, and it is expanding, moving toward Earth.

The aliens are running from it. The entire heralds mission (including [Alekandras](Characters/Alekandras.md) journey) exists to warn humanity and prepare a defense. The cosmic threat is the ultimate antagonist of the story - the reason everything is happening.

## 4. Alien's Society and Politics

- **Government:** The Homeworld has (or had) a governing body - referred to as the "twin planet council" (or equivalent authority) - that decided policy, including which the best minds were chosen for off-world missions.
- **Not a monolith:** The aliens were not unified. They had politics, disagreements, and internal conflicts. Some believed in helping humanity; others (like [Apophis](Characters/Apophis.md)) went rogue and turned hostile.
- **Multiple missions:** Multiple heralds were sent to Earth and they landed at different times and to different regions - this is why ancient, unconnected human cultures all have stories of hybrid beasts (see [Bestiary](Bestiary.md)).

## 5. The Mission

- **Purpose:** Warn humanity about the approaching cosmic threat and help Earth's civilizations advance quickly enough to build a defense before the threat arrives.
- **Stakes:** If the mission fails, both the Homeworld (already dying) and Earth will be consumed. The protagonist's drive is to save both worlds - theirs and humanity's.
- **Regional landings:** Each herald landed in a different part of the world - Egypt, Northern Europe, Greece, Asia, North America, and elsewhere - causing localized mythologies based on the fauna we know today (see [Bestiary](Bestiary.md)).

## 6. Connection to Earth

Earth is not just a random habitable planet. It is a biological sister to the Homeworld - connected by planetary resonance. This sisterhood means life that evolves on the two planets shares a compatible evolutionary path.

## 7. Notes

- The Homeworld is always spoken of as dying or already lost - the heralds are refugees as much as they are messengers.
