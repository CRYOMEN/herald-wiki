# Alien and Human Technology — Reference

## 1. Overview

- **Human technology (2070):** Tied to hardware and silicon. Robots and AI run on electricity; materials are metal, composite materials, and solid mineral components. Human exoskeletons are metal/iron, with a cockpit and fuel-based operation. **Note:** The 2070 world is not cyberpunk. It is a normal society with advanced technology, AI, and medicine—ordinary people living ordinary lives, just with high-end tech. No neon-lit dystopia or cyberpunk aesthetic.
- **Alien technology:** Tied to bioengineering. Aliens are experts in how the body works, how cells function, and how to build and develop living bodies. The protagonist arrives on Earth with biotechnologies; the story is built on this knowledge.

## 2. Human technology (2070)

### 2.1 General

- **Basis:** Hardware, silicon. Technologies are “solid”: metal, composite materials, stone-like or mineral components.
- **Power:** Electricity.
- **Exoskeletons (human):** A person sits inside a cockpit; the exoskeleton is made of metal/iron and runs on fuel.

### 2.2 Artificial intelligence and robotics

- **AI:** Much more advanced than in the present. Described as likely self-aware, able to understand itself, express thoughts, and act autonomously.
- **Robots:** Platforms that AI can control. Made of metal and composite materials, running on electricity.
- **AI “brains”:** Essentially computers; physically made of metal and composite materials.

## 3. Alien technology — Living Suit (exoskeleton)

### 3.1 Nature and appearance

- The Living Suit is a **living organism**: an exoskeleton that is alive and functions as an additional body. The alien sits inside it; what people see is the suit’s distinctive outward form.
- **Pilot interface:** The occupant controls the suit through a **neural interface**. Pilot and suit function as **one**—direct sensorimotor feedback, not a “cockpit” experience. (Injury, exhaustion, or overload can propagate across the link.)
- **Typical form:** Imposing, non-humanoid—powerful build, multiple limbs (often four, sometimes two), prominent head and jaw. Morphology varies by herald.
- **Variation between suits:** Different heralds have suits that differ in shape and look. Some variants have flight capability; others use different technology to move or fly.
- **Self-modification:** Suits can self-modify within certain limits. For example, the occupant can change the suit's configuration—e.g. reduce appendages and move on four limbs only.

### 3.2 Power and maintenance

- **Energy source:** The exoskeleton eats. The suit uses this to heal and repair itself. The food is converted into energy, building blocks for cells, and waste, going from being ground in the mouth to being broken down in the stomach and absorbing nutrients (glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids) into the bloodstream through the small intestine. Undigested waste is converted into feces in the large intestine and eliminated from the body. The entire process takes 2 to 5 days.
- **Special energy:** A separate “special” energy is used for creating life forms (bestiary). Creating beasts consumes this energy, and it is very hard to recharge. Depletion of this energy is a main reason the protagonist enters hibernation; he plans to wake around 2200 and use the remainder to help counter the cosmic threat.
- **Extending mission energy:** Emotional and intimate connection with humans (e.g. love, physical connection) was found to increase the suit’s energy, allowing the protagonist to extend his mission in Ancient Egypt.

### 3.3 Capabilities

- **Life-form creation:** The suit can create life forms. It can replicate a creature it has observed, or combine DNA (e.g. dog + cow + other elements, or adding wings) to create hybrids. It functions as a mobile laboratory for mixing DNA and creating new species. Creating these beings consumes the suit’s special energy (see above).
- **Hibernation:** When the suit/alien sleeps, much less energy is spent. In the plot the protagonist goes into hibernation roughly two to three years before Cleopatra’s death (c. 30 BC), intending to wake around 2200 when humanity would have advanced knowledge and technology.

### 3.5 Biomass decomposition

- Artificially created life forms (e.g. monsters) also decompose quickly after death, leaving biomass.

### 3.6 Suit assistant

- The suit does not operate alone; it has an **assistant**. This is a standard feature of alien suits.
- **Nature:** The assistant is alive and sentient—it can think, has fears, worries, emotions, possesses and can acquire knowledge, and can speak. It is described as somewhat similar to a Seraphim (many appendages, not quite human-like), possibly with long, thick tentacles; exact appearance not final.
- **Role:** Takes measurements of the suit; can **detach** and act as a separate unit. Teaches the alien; knows a lot about technology.
- **Loyalty:** Always 100% loyal to whoever is currently inside the suit.
