# Alien and Human Technology - Reference

## 1. Overview

- **Human technology (2070):** Tied to hardware and silicon. Robots and AI run on electricity; materials are metal, composite materials, and solid mineral components. Human exoskeletons are metal/iron, with a cockpit and fuel-based operation. **Note:** The 2070 world is not cyberpunk. It is a normal society with advanced technology, AI, and medicine—ordinary people living ordinary lives, just with high-end tech. No neon-lit dystopia or cyberpunk aesthetic.
- **Alien technology:** Tied to bioengineering - pure "wetware." Aliens are experts in how the body works, how cells function, and how to build and develop living bodies. The protagonist arrives on Earth with biotechnologies; the story is built on this knowledge. Where human tech is rigid and dry (silicon, metal, plastic, wires pushing electricity to simulate thinking), the Herald's technology is alive: living organisms, biomass, symbiotic systems.

## 2. Human technology (2070)

### 2.1 General

- **Basis:** Hardware, silicon. Technologies are “solid”: metal, composite materials, stone-like or mineral components.
- **Power:** Electricity.
- **Exoskeletons (human):** A person sits inside a cockpit; the exoskeleton is made of metal/iron and runs on fuel.

### 2.2 Artificial intelligence and robotics

- **AI:** Much more advanced than in the present. Described as likely self-aware, able to understand itself, express thoughts, and act autonomously.
- **Robots:** Platforms that AI can control. Made of metal and composite materials, running on electricity.
- **AI “brains”:** Essentially computers; physically made of metal and composite materials.

## 3. Alien technology - Living Suit (exoskeleton)

### 3.1 Nature and appearance

- The Living Suit is a **living organism** - a **symbiotic exoskeleton** that is alive and functions as an additional body. Think of it less like an Iron Man suit and more like a massive genetically engineered creature that you ride inside of. The alien sits inside it; what people see is the suit’s distinctive outward form.
- **Pilot interface:** The occupant controls the suit through a **neural interface** - they literally share a nervous system. Pilot and suit function as **one**—direct sensorimotor feedback, not a “cockpit” experience. (Injury, exhaustion, or overload can propagate across the link.)
- **Typical form:** Imposing, non-humanoid - powerful build, roughly 2.4 meters tall, multiple limbs (often four, sometimes two), prominent head and massive jaw, thick armored skin. Morphology varies by herald.
- **Variation between suits:** Different heralds have suits that differ in shape and look. Some variants have flight capability; others use different technology to move or fly.
- **Self-modification:** Suits can self-modify within certain limits. For example, the occupant can change the suit's configuration—e.g. reduce appendages and move on four limbs only.

### 3.2 Power and maintenance

- **Energy source:** The exoskeleton eats - it has a mouth and a full digestive system. It requires caloric intake, consuming organic matter (plants, animals, whatever is available). The suit uses this to heal and repair itself. The food is converted into energy, building blocks for cells, and waste, going from being ground in the mouth to being broken down in the stomach and absorbing nutrients (glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids) into the bloodstream through the small intestine. Undigested waste is converted into feces in the large intestine and eliminated from the body. The entire process takes 2 to 5 days.
- **Special energy:** A separate “special” energy is used for creating life forms (bestiary). Creating beasts consumes this energy, and it is very hard to recharge. Depletion of this energy is a main reason the protagonist enters hibernation; he plans to wake around 2200 and use the remainder to help counter the cosmic threat.
- **Extending mission energy (neurochemical resonance):** Intense physical and emotional intimacy creates a neurochemical feedback loop that the suit can harvest for a small trickle of "special energy". The dopamine, oxytocin, and bioelectric output of a profound emotional and physical connection provide this energy - love is, in a strict bioelectric sense, a battery. This mechanism was found to increase the suit’s "special energy".

### 3.3 Capabilities

- **Life-form creation:** The suit is a mobile laboratory - a genetic synthesizer. It can sample DNA from the local environment, splice organisms together, and create new viable life forms. It can replicate a creature it has observed, or combine DNA (e.g. dog + cow + other elements, or adding wings) to create hybrids. It functions as a mobile laboratory for mixing DNA and creating new species. Creating these beings consumes the suit’s special energy (see above).

### 3.6 Biomass decomposition

- Artificially created life forms (e.g. monsters) decompose quickly after death, leaving biomass - they revert back to their base proteins. This is why no Minotaur skeletons are ever found. It is a self-cleaning mechanism built into the genetic constructs.

### 3.7 Suit assistant

- The suit does not operate alone; it has an **assistant**. This is a standard feature of all alien suits. See [Iko](Characters/Iko.md) character sheet for example.
- **Nature:** The assistant is alive and sentient - it can think, has fears, worries, emotions, possesses and can acquire knowledge, and can speak. Functions as a biological drone.
- **Role:** Takes measurements of the suit; can **detach** and act as a separate unit. Teaches the alien; knows a lot about technology.
- **Loyalty:** Always 100% loyal to whoever is currently inside the suit.
