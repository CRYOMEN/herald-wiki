# Bestiary - Reference

## 1. Overview

- The bestiary consists of creatures created by aliens (heralds) using their Living Suits.
- Not all entries were created by the same alien or at the same time; multiple aliens were sent to Earth from the [Homeworld](Homeworld.md) at different times, and each could create new life forms.
- Creation is done via the Living Suit (exoskeleton), which functions as a mobile laboratory: it can mix DNA of different creatures and produce new species or hybrids. Heralds create humanoid hybrids (e.g. werewolf, minotaur, horse-headed human) but do not create ordinary humans (or this is not recorded).
- The secret organization (founded in Ancient Egypt) hunts both aliens  themselves and their creations: artifacts and creatures.
- Many of these hybrids were perceived as gods (e.g. zoomorphic gods in Ancient Egypt) and later influenced mythology (e.g. Greek).
- **Unified theory of mythology:** Because each herald landed in a different region and sampled different local fauna, they created entirely different mythologies. This is why ancient, unconnected cultures all have stories of hybrid beasts - the heralds were literally manufacturing them as local defense forces or laborers. The bestiary is, in effect, a biological explanation for all of world mythology.

## 2. Creation mechanics

- Beasts/monsters are created by the alien’s Living Suit; the suit can replicate a creature it has “seen” or combine DNA (e.g. dog + cow + other elements, or adding wings).
- Creating beasts consumes special energy of the exoskeleton; this energy is difficult to recharge. Depletion of this energy is a reason the protagonist entered hibernation.
- The creatures are artificially created life forms; after death they decompose quickly but leave biomass (technical trait of such forms).

## 3. Physical and behavioral traits

- **Build:** Powerful, dominant, very muscular. Height up to about 2 m 40 cm. Strong, resilient. Often described as huge, much taller than humans, with claws, fangs, and either scales or fur; eyes described as “really wild.”
- **Temperament:** Wild. Behavior is strongly influenced by mixed DNA; they do not behave like ordinary humans.
- **Sexuality:** Many hybrids (e.g. Werewolf, Lizardman, Centaur, Sphinx, Anubis) are described as very lustful toward each other and toward humans; sexual interest in humans and desire for contact or unions (including love) are noted.
- **Sentience:** They are sentient: they have desires, emotions, fears, can speak, and can coexist with ordinary people. They lived alongside humans and in some eras (e.g. Ancient Egypt) were treated as divine or semi-divine.

## 4. Mortality and reproduction

- **Immortality:** None of the bestiary creatures (human–animal hybrids, unicorns, pegasus, etc.) are immortal. They age and die. Because they are artificial constructs of the suit, when they die they decompose incredibly rapidly into a kind of biomass fluid - they revert back to their base proteins. This is why no hybrid skeletons are ever found in the archaeological record.
- **Life expectancy:** Varies by form; not specified per type.
- **Reproduction:** They reproduce only with humans (copulation). All such creatures are male. Pregnancy from them is rare but possible; offspring are the same hybrid type (e.g. minotaur begets minotaur). Offspring grow relatively quickly compared to humans.
- **Population:** Reproduction with humans was kept secret, especially by the hybrid/beast society. In the settlement (2070), very few monsters live among people, but they exist; all such species survived to the present through reproduction with humans.

## 5. Secrecy

- Humans and monsters jointly keep the existence of monsters secret from the outside world.
- In 2070, there is a very small but stable population of these monsters living secretly all around the world. Their society has a memory-erasure technology in rare cases to erase specific parts of memory. Used to: erase parts of memory about monster community from anyone leaving the community. This supports keeping the secret.

## 6. Death and decomposition

- Monsters die and decompose quickly; biomass remains after them (technical feature of artificially created life forms).

## 8. Story and usage

- **Notable creations by protagonist:** Werewolf, Minotaur, Anubis (Ancient Egypt; worshipped as a god), Lizardman, Sobek. The hero remained in Egypt throughout his time on Earth; he did not travel to remote regions to create creatures or build armies elsewhere.
- **Creations by other heralds:** Other hybrids and monsters across the world were created by other heralds - for example, [Arturas](Characters/Arturas.md) created few new species in England (including the Unicorn, during the Middle Ages). Each herald operated in their own region and sampled different local fauna, which is why mythologies differ across cultures. Regional examples: In Northern Europe sampled wolves and horses, producing the myths of werewolves, Fenrir, and unicorns. In Greece, humans + horses = centaurs, humans + goats = satyrs, humans + bulls = minotaurs. In Asia, the same principle produced Naga (serpent-human hybrids), and Tengu (birdmen) in Japan. All these ancient, unconnected cultures have hybrid-beast stories because the heralds were creating them.
- **Armies:** The protagonist created armies of beasts in Egypt; these were used rarely to keep their existence secret. Example: defense against Apophis (a herald who became an antagonist) and his minions in Egypt (the big war between Amun-Ra and Apophis).
- **Settlement (2070):** A settlement of followers (e.g. “followers of Cleopatra”) guards the sleeping herald. Monsters exist there in small numbers; people and monsters keep the monsters’ existence secret and use memory erasure when needed.
- **Alien appearance (without suit):** Aliens are not humanoid and not “classic alien”; they are described as beast-like, animal-like, and larger than humans. The suit has a distinctive, imposing form: multiple limbs (often four, sometimes two), prominent head and jaw; morphology varies by herald (some with flight capability, some without).
