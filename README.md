### Corrections to the audio

The AI narration may get some details wrong. Use this section as a quick reference for what to ignore or correct when watching:

- *The 2070 city does not have a cyberpunk aesthetic. It will look like a normal metropolis without all those neon lights you usually see in cyberpunk games.*
- *The Homeworld is not a binary star system. It's a binary planet system.*
- *The Homeworld is dying. The herald's mission is to find a way to save both worlds—theirs and humanity's.*
- *The hero did not travel from Egypt to remote places to synthesize hybrids or build an army. Other hybrids/monsters were created by other heralds, for example, by Arturas in England.*
- *The hero did not help to modify the DNA of his beloved human. Instead, she (the human) did it after Cleopatra's death with the help of his suit assistant. At that time, our herald was already sleeping. He knows nothing about it. Jasmine at 2070 also does not know about her ancient past.*
- *After the shell hit, the pod didn't activate its emergency protocol. The awakening program simply began malfunctioning and collecting energy from outside. After about 15 minutes, the energy had accumulated to such an extent that it triggered the capsule's teleportation.*
- *The soldiers and people did not freeze instantly; they tried to find a safer place but could not.*
- *The hero knows nothing about Jasmine after crashing in the metropolis in 2070. There is no connection between them at all.*
- *In 2070, there is no classic cyberpunk society. It's normal people but with high-end tech, AI, medicine, etc. It has nothing to do with the cyberpunk vibe we know today from movies and games.*
- *The Secret Organization hunts both heralds and their creations: artifacts and creatures.*
